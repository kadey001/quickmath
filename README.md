# Quick Math

A computation game made with Flutter and Firebase.

## How it works
Equations are generated based on difficulty (Easy, Normal, Hard), with a goal of solving as many of them within 60 seconds as possible. Score is awarded for each correct answer and removed for no/wrong answers. The high scores are stored in Firebase allowing for the possiblity of leaderboards and user data avaliable across devices.
